# SocketTestQ
A C++/Qt powered tool for socket testing. It can create both TCP and UDP client or server. It can be used to test any server or client that uses TCP or UDP protocol to communicate.

Inspired from SocketTest v 3.0.0 (developed in Java). I developed this tool because in SocketTest we can't send files and we are limited to CRLF terminated strings whereas in some cases we need to send null terminated strings. But it is also an attempt to show that with C++/Qt we can build interesting applications in no time... and much more faster than those built with Java ;)

Don't hesitate to email me for any suggestion.
